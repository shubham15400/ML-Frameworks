Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, where the input-output pairs are known, to make predictions on new, unseen data. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, deals with unlabeled data and focuses on discovering hidden patterns or structures within the data. Reinforcement learning is inspired by behavioral psychology and involves training models to make a sequence of decisions by interacting with an environment to achieve a specific goal.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><strong>Git</strong> is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project by tracking changes to the codebase over time. It provides a robust way to manage the history of file changes, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions of code when necessary. Git is widely used in software development and data science projects for maintaining code integrity, managing branches for different features or experiments, and integrating changes smoothly.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>What is Version Control?</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><strong>Version control</strong> is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It is essential for collaborative work environments where multiple people contribute to the same project, allowing teams to work simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. Version control also helps in maintaining a history of changes, making it easy to revert to previous versions, understand the evolution of the project, and ensure that code modifications are documented and traceable.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Benefits of Using Git for Version Control</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Distributed System:</strong> Unlike centralized version control systems, Git allows every user to have a complete copy of the repository, including its history. This makes it robust and fault-tolerant.</li>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Git facilitates collaboration by allowing multiple developers to work on different branches simultaneously. Changes can be merged back into the main branch after review.</li>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Track Changes:</strong> Git tracks every modification to the codebase, making it easy to see who made changes, why, and when. This is crucial for debugging and auditing purposes.</li>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Revert Changes:</strong> If a change introduces a bug or breaks functionality, Git allows you to easily revert to a previous stable version of the code.</li>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Branching and Merging:</strong> Git's branching model allows developers to create multiple branches for different features or experiments. Once the changes are finalized, they can be merged back into the main branch.</li>\n",
